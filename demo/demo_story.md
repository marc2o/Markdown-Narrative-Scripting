% A Very Simple Markdown Narrative Scripting Example

## The Beginning

You are at **the beginning**. Where _everything_ starts. Either with or without styled text.

Choices will have to be made. As always.

- [Go somewhere else](somewhere-else)
- [Just keep waiting](still-here)

## Somewhere Else

![Picture this](https://picsum.photos/800/400)

The grass isnâ€™t exactly greener over here. Just a trick of light. A change of position often comes with a change in perspective.

- [Return to the beginning](the-beginning)

## Still Here

Time is ticking. Nothing happens.

- [Look around](the-beginning)
- [Come back tomorrow](end)

## End

The end.
